# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). For a security system the changelog
is what lets you decide whether to take an update, so entries say what changed
in behaviour, not just "fixes".

## [0.0.1] — Phase 0, walking skeleton

Not for protecting a house: there are no codes, and alarm state is not kept
across a restart.

### Added
- Config flow: one area, one scenario, one zone with an explicitly confirmed
  trigger state. Unavailable and unknown cannot be chosen as trigger states.
- Configuration stored in `.storage/foyer.config` with a schema version and a
  migration hook.
- Pure decision engine, `decide(snapshot, event, config, now)`.
- `alarm_control_panel.foyer_<area>`: arm and disarm go through the engine.
  Arming is refused while the zone is open or unavailable, and the refusal
  names the zone.
- The zone triggers the armed area.
- A persistent notification on armed, disarmed and zone fault.
- Sidebar panel with a live status screen and its help section.
- `foyer-card`: area state and an arm button.
- English and Italian throughout.
